# Myntra Demo
This is a simple application built during the new joinees' initiation bootcamp.
This was built in an attempt to learn basic android concepts, and build an Android application,
that can perform an Async Task, make network calls, handle JSON data, and build RecyclerView based
layouts.

## Concepts / Technologies Learnt
The following concepts and technologies were learnt about, and experimented with over the course
of building this application -

- Types of Layouts used to build views. (LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, etc.)
- Intents, and using them to pass data between Activities.
- RecyclerView and Adapters, to build lists and grids.
- AsyncTasks and HttpUrlConnection to make network calls.
- Retrofit, Annotations, and their uses to simplify networking.
- GSON

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express sincere gratitude to @amarjain07 and @muditpant13 for their constant guidance and tutelage, without which embarking a journey into Android Dev would have been a lot more haphazard, and tedious.
